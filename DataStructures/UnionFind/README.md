| Union Find |

This Data-Type/Algorithm is a way of solving various dynamic connectivity problems.
In simple terms: Are two objects connected in system (social network, computer network...)? 

There are a few ways to implement UnionFind, including QuickFind, QuickUnion, and WeightedQuickUnion.
Each one has it's strengths and weaknesses.
A good union find implementation will be able to connect objects and check if two objects are 
connected in a reasonable amount using a reasonable amount of memory.

Applications:

- Pixels in a digital photo
- Computers in a network
- Friends in a social network
- Transistors in a computer chip
- Elements in a mathimatical set
- Variable names in a Fortran program
- Metallic sites in a compisite system
